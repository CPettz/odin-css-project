# odin-css-project
The main purpose of this project is to practice many of the css skills that have been developed as part of The Odin Project (TOP) CSS Fundamentals curiculum. Specifically, this project is meant to practice CSS skills by replicating an existing design concept that has been shared. All of the code for this project was developed from scratch.
